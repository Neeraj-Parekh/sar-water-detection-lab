## **Option 3: Story-Driven**

🌊 From Research to Production: Building an Open-Source SAR Water Detection Lab

**The Journey:**
Started as a research project to improve flood detection from Sentinel-1 radar imagery. Quickly realized the tools available were either:
❌ Too simple (basic thresholding)  
❌ Too complex (research code, not production-ready)  
❌ Closed-source (expensive, inflexible)

**The Build:**
Spent months implementing and testing 47+ water detection algorithms:
- Classical: Otsu, CFAR, GLCM Texture
- Advanced: Morphological Snake, Frangi Vesselness
- ML/DL: Attention U-Net, LightGBM Ensemble
- Custom: Python equation engine

**The Result:**
A production-grade, interactive tool that:
✅ Runs in Docker (one command deployment)  
✅ Processes 10-15 satellite scenes/minute  
✅ Supports real-time parameter tuning  
✅ Exports reproducible configurations  
✅ Includes QA/audit system  

**The Tech:**
Python, Streamlit, PyTorch, scikit-learn, GDAL, Docker
~15,000 lines of code
1,300+ lines of documentation

**Why Share It?**
Because better tools lead to better decisions about:
🌍 Climate adaptation  
💧 Water resources  
🚨 Disaster response  
📊 Environmental monitoring
