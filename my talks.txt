my talks 

too hard to make  ths oen by one on each chip , i think we hould create a gui first 



 


todo - 

1. see and compare with google maps data as per location written in js script 


2. what if we create a program that is like a gui that shows me realtime edits shown on the chips in multiple different window like one a same screen there are 15 windows with initially blank and then as we select various filter on the chips , its being showcased there ,

there is a option to make it blank again individually any window 

these window are like square boxes in the gui itself with label placeholder that changes as per which filter is presnt in them 


then there is a extra row with original vv vh ,mndwi , hand , twi ,dem, slope present 

and at the end there is a final row window for  with composite of all present filters and a final result with water percent shown , this thing final row has only window of only these 2 things , and it is always auto updated as we select the filter and see the result 


each window has placeholder that shows - fitler name , version no. and percent of water 

behaviour of window - > 

    i select filter from options and which data to put that filter on ,and it appears on the window , it automatically sets the name version etc and also option to manually name or change their version , 

    the water level label is not changable by me at all 

    option to create a custom sequence /flow with certain type of filter with certain maths threshold or values specific for that filter i can put to create it ,

    

    

    

rules for the option 

    only one data/filter select option as well

    set custom maths + rules + threshold as well 

    select only one filter  / raw product  for a single window 

    select multiple product filter for a single window

    a option to add just the percent of water i want , and the whole maths  and everyythign is calculated as per it and gives several differnt combination ( min.15) to suggest calculatiosn + windows that will match that output

    option to set threshold and level of marking for each filter type 

    

the options are as follows fsudor the filter portion -> 

    s1 , s2 , hand with threshold limit ,  , 

        definite 

        probable 

        possible 

        curvature 

        continuity 

        width filtered 

        fusion - high conf , med conf , etc
